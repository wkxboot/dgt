## Overview
-----------
This example demonstrates configuration and use of the SPI slave module in interrupt-driven
mode on communication with a SPI master module calling the SPI functional APIs. This project
should work together with `spi_interrupt_master` example.

**Transactional API and Functional API**

- Low level functional APIs provide common peripheral functionality, abstracting the 
  hardware peripheral register access into a set of state less basic functional operations.
  These APIs primarily focus on the control, configuration, and function of basic 
  peripheral operations. 

- Transactional APIs provide a quick method for customers to utilize higher-level 
  functionality of the peripherals. The transactional APIs utilize interrupts and perform 
  asynchronous operations without user intervention. Transactional APIs operate on high-
  level logic that requires data storage for internal operation context handling. However,
  the peripheral drivers do not allocate this memory space. Rather, the user passes in the
  memory to the driver for internal driver operation. 

- All driver examples calling the transactional API get the `transfer` in the project 
  naming. If the code size and performance are critical requirements, see the 
  transactional API implementation and write custom code.

## Functional Description
-------------------------
In this example, SPI slave will communicate with a master module on another board, 
master will use interrupt mode and slave will use interrupt mode too.

1. Once the project starts, main routine will initialize clock, pin mux configuration, 
   and configure the SPI module to make it work in slave interrupt mode to communicate
   with master module.

2. SPI slave is driven by receive-ready interrupt, one byte will be written to transmit 
   register first in main routine to waiting for the master module starts the communication.
   While the data from master is ready, a interrupt will be triggerred.   
   
3. In IRQ handler routine, slave will receive data and send another byte to the master 
   module until all data has been written to the transmit register.

4. Main routine will wait until the tansmission complete, checking if the data from 
   master is all right when transfer complete, and print the received data and information
   to the debug console on PC.

5. De-initialize the SPI module.

## Toolchain Supported
---------------------
- IAR embedded Workbench 8.11.3
- Keil MDK 5.23
- MCUXpresso10.1.0

## Hardware Requirements
------------------------
- Micro USB cable
- LPCXpresso824MAX board
- Personal Computer

## Board Settings
------------------------
Connect pins of SPI master and slave(on another board) as below:

    Master - SPI0                  Slave - SPI0   
Pin Name   Board Location      Pin Name   Board Location            
MISO       J1 pin 6            MISO       J1 pin 6                     
MOSI       J1 pin 7            MOSI       J1 pin 7                
SCK        J1 pin 5            SCK        J1 pin 5                 
SSEL0      J1 pin 8            SSEL0      J1 pin 8
GND        J1 pin 4            GND        J1 pin 4

## Run the Project
------------------------
Run this example by performing the following steps:

1. Connect a micro USB cable between the PC host and the CMSIS DAP port(J3 on the 
   LPCXpresso824MAX board) for receiving debug information.

2. Open a serial terminal in PC(for example PUTTY) with the following settings:
   - 9600 baud rate
   - 8 data bits
   - No parity
   - One stop bit
   - No flow control

3. Compile and download the program to the target board.
   More information about how to compile and program the project can refer to 

   [Getting Started with MCUXpresso SDK](../../../../../docs/Getting Started with MCUXpresso SDK.pdf).

4. Launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running this project, start the master example on another
   board.

5. Monitor the information on the debug console.

## Expected Result
------------------------
The SPI slave module will communicate with slave module in interrupt mode, slave module 
should be started first. Once the communication between master board and slave board is 
completed, the received data and information will be printed to the debug console on PC.
